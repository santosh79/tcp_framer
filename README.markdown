# TCP Framer -- Frames raw TCP messages

## Usage

Create the framer

	var framer = require('tcp_framer');
	

Mix in the framer into your socket and wait for the **message** event:

	var server = net.createServer(function (socket) {
  		framer.frame(socket);
  		
  		socket.on('message', function(msg) {
  			console.log('This is the full message %s',msg);
  		})
	});

For sending a message with a frame header call the **writeMessage** method:

	socket.writeMessage("Lorem Ipsum Blah Di Blahâ€¦");
	
	

## Install

	npm install tcp_framer
